        <h3>Homemade Granola</h3>

        <p>Homemade granola is one of those recipes that I make in big batches, I store it in big kilner jars and use it in my breakfast almost every day!

        <h3>Pan Fried Trout and Fennel Salad</h3>

        <p>Fennel brings a level of decadence to any recipe, sliced properly, it looks like beautiful curled riboons knotted within your dish. This warm pan fried rainbow trout and fennel salad is a fairly luxurious dinner whilst being quick and easy to make. It makes and ideal mideweek meal and if you wait until the last minute to add the baby watercress... <a href="#">Read more</a></p>
